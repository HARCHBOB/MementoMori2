# MementoMori

MementoMori is a powerful and flexible web app designed to help users memorize everything from historical dates to complex concepts and vocabulary for learning new languages. Whether you are a student preparing for exams or someone looking to master a new language, MementoMori offers a customizable and engaging experience to improve memory retention and enhance learning.

## Features

### 1. Flashcards

MementoMori allows you to create dynamic flashcards that can include text to help you memorize a variety of content, from language vocabulary to historical facts. Flashcards are the core component of the app, giving users a versatile tool to break down complex information into digestible pieces, making memorization more effective.

### 2. Deck Creation and Editing

Easily organize your flashcards into decks based on topics, subjects, or languages. The deck creation feature provides a simple interface to add, edit, and delete cards within each deck. You can customize the structure and content of each deck to match your specific learning needs, ensuring a personalized study experience.

### 3. Algorithm for Spaced Repetition

MementoMori uses a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize your study schedule. This algorithm spaces out review sessions based on how well you remember each card, increasing the intervals between reviews for well-known items and focusing more on difficult ones. This method ensures efficient long-term retention by preventing cramming and minimizing forgetting.

### 4. Streaks, Dailies, and Quests

To keep users motivated, MementoMori incorporates a gamified learning experience. Complete daily study sessions to maintain streaks and earn rewards. Additionally, quests provide specific learning challenges, which offer various incentives. This system helps keep you engaged and consistent with your study routine.

### 5. Customization

MementoMori offers customization options to enhance your learning experience. Personalize your study sessions by selecting from a variety of card skins and backgrounds, allowing you to create a visually appealing and engaging interface. This level of personalization ensures that your study environment is not only effective but also uniquely yours.

### 6. Deck Import / Export

Share your decks with others or transfer them between devices with the deck import and export feature. You can export your custom-made decks into standard formats and import decks from other sources, allowing for flexibility in how you acquire and distribute learning material.

### 7. Deck Browser

The Deck Browser allows you to explore a wide range of pre-made decks created by other users or the community. You can search, filter, and preview decks in various categories, making it easy to find decks that align with your learning goals. This feature also provides an excellent way to expand your knowledge base without starting from scratch.
